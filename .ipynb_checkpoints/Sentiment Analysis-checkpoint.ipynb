    "## Lemmatization is another interesting technique, it reduces the words to their base form. This is very useful when dealing with different forms of words, such as verb conjugations or plural nouns, allowing for more accurate analysis or comparison of words in text data.\n",
    "## I also perform a basic contractions handling, this also improve the analysis accuracy on the text, but I just did a basic handling for the most common contractions, this could be improved by looking up for a list of all contractions and adding them to the dictionary.\n",
    "## Reddit allow users to add http links on their comments, and this http links affect negatively on sentiment analysis, so all links are removed from the text data.\n",
    "## Special characters were also removed as they can affect the interpretation of the text data, although during my research I found that some people argue that the SIA is capable of interpreting some special characters and that they would enforce the context analisys performed by the method, my tests were inconclusive about this, so I decided to remove the special characters to ensure that the data is clean and reliable.\n",
    "## There was an attempt to preprocess text with repeated characters e.g('Thaaanks','WoooW', 'soooo goooood') and reduce those words for their original form, but that was very challeging, time consuming and I have no experience to evaluate if the improvement this would be bring to the text analysis would be worth the time it would required to make it work."
